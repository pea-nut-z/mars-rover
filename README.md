### Context

A web page that fetches and displays data from NASA and Nature News APIs. All information of what is currently happening on Mars gathered in one place for easy view.
Testing for this project involves spying on the implementation, and mocking returned data and errors for each api call. It has a testing coverage of 98.86%.

### To get started

The Nature News API has its CORS enabled only for localhost - hence the news section is missing in the link above. To view the full project, clone the repository and view locally.
