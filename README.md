### Context

A web page that fetches and displays data from NASA and Nature News APIs. Latest weather, news and images gathered in one place for easy view. You can also search and favorite images - local storage is used.

It is fully tested by spying on the implementation, mocking returned data and errors.

### Note

The Nature News API has its CORS enabled only for localhost - hence the news section is missing in the link above. To view the full project, clone the repository and view locally.

Due to NASA's lack of updates on images from Opportunity and Spirit rovers, there may be no results when you search for their images on most dates. This is why Curiosity rover's images are showcased on the homepage instead of other rovers. Try searching under the Curiosity rover for better results.
