### Context

A web page that fetches and displays data from NASA and Nature News APIs. All information of what is currently happening on Mars gathered in one place for easy view.
Testing for this project involves spying on the implementation, and mocking returned data and errors for each api call. It has a testing coverage of 98.86%.

### Road blocks

The Nature News API has its CORS enabled only for localhost - hence the news section is missing on the link above. Please clone this repository and view locally for completeness.
