  "Atmosphere Opacity: Weather on Mars is more extreme than Earth's. Mars is cooler and with bigger differences between day and night temperatures. Moreover, dust storms lash its surface. However, Mars' and Earth's climates have important similarities, such as the polar ice caps or seasonal changes.As on Earth, on Mars we can have sunny, cloudy or windy days, for example.";

const season =
  "Season: A Martian year is divided in 12 months, as Earth's. However, Martian months are from 46 to 67 sols (Martian days) long. The longest one is the month 3 (67 sols), and the shortest one is the month 9 (46 sols) Martian months mark seasonal changes. In the southern hemisphere (Curiosity rover location) the autumn starts in month 1; the winter in month 4; the spring in month 7; and the summer in month 10.";
